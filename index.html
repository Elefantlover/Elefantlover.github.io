    <h1>Travel to ....</h1>
    <h3 id="below_header">...Fuse33! That would be a <i> swell </i> idea!</h3>

    <p class="p1">
        Fuse33 is a community makerspace where people can come in and build pretty much anything they want. <br><br>

    <p class="p1"> For example:
    <p>

        <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/space/rocketship.png"
            alt="A picture of a cartoon-style rocket ship">

    <p class="p1"> ##Depicting a very limited rendition of the u.s.s. Enterprise NCC-1701-d, because I couldn't figure
        out how to do the site-restricted Google search (keeps saying server not accepted) </p> <br>

    <p class="p1"> Or perhaps: </p> <br>

    <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/space/8.png" alt=""> <br>

    <p class="p1"> ##Limited depiction of a CNC-router-engraved figure eight (hard to see because, well, it's in big
        part in my imagination) </p> <br>

    <p class="p1"> Anyway, I finally figured out how to use wikipedia images, so here's what Fuse33's electronics area
        sort of looks like: </p>

    <br> <br>
    <p class="p1"> Fuse33, along with Protospace,
        are two similar makerspaces residing in a city that looks like this (easily identifiable by the tower on the
        left): </p> <br> <br>

        width="400" alt="cityscape with multiple towers"> <br><br><br><br>

    <p class="p1"> Let's close with some enticing links, shall we?</p><br>

    <p class="p1"> Let me just imagine you nodding you head for a moment... </p> <br>

    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Pivot.gif/240px-Pivot.gif" alt="funny GIF"
        width="70%"><br>

    <p class="p1"> I know I know, not a nodding head... But I couldn't find any on Wikipedia, so yeah. </p>
    <br><br>

    <p class="p1"> Here are links to some makerspaces/hackerspaces found around the globe. Find one near you! <br><br>
